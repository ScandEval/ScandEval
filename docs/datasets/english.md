This is an overview of all the datasets used in the English part of EuroEval. The
datasets are grouped by their task - see the [task overview](/tasks) for more
information about what these constitute.


## Sentiment Classification

### SST-5

This dataset was published in [this paper](https://aclanthology.org/D13-1170/) and is
based on movie reviews from rottentomatoes.com, labelled by crowdsourced workers on
Amazon Mechanical Turk.

The original full dataset consists of 8,540 / 1,100 / 2,210 samples for the training,
validation and test splits, respectively. We use 1,024 / 256 / 2,048 samples for our
training, validation and test splits, respectively. All the new splits are subsets of
the original splits.

The original dataset consists of 5 labels instead of our usual 3, but we map them to
`positive`, `neutral` and `negative` as follows:

- `very negative` ➡️ `negative`
- `negative` ➡️ `negative`
- `neutral` ➡️ `neutral`
- `positive` ➡️ `positive`
- `very positive` ➡️ `positive`

Here are a few examples from the training split:

```json
{
  "text": "the leads are natural and lovely , the pace is serene , the humor wry and sprightly .",
  "label": "positive"
}
```
```json
{
  "text": "labute ca n't avoid a fatal mistake in the modern era : he 's changed the male academic from a lower-class brit to an american , a choice that upsets the novel 's exquisite balance and shreds the fabric of the film .",
  "label": "neutral"
}
```
```json
{
  "text": "no cliche escapes the perfervid treatment of gang warfare called ces wild .",
  "label": "negative"
}
```

When evaluating generative models, we use the following setup (see the
[methodology](/methodology) for more information on how these are used):

- Number of few-shot examples: 12
- Prefix prompt:
  ```
  The following are texts and their sentiment, which can be 'positive', 'neutral' or 'negative'.
  ```
- Base prompt template:
  ```
  Text: {text}
  Sentiment: {label}
  ```
- Instruction-tuned prompt template:
  ```
  Text: {text}

  Classify the sentiment in the text. Answer with 'positive', 'neutral' or 'negative'.
  ```
- Label mapping:
    - `positive` ➡️ `positive`
    - `neutral` ➡️ `neutral`
    - `negative` ➡️ `negative`

```bash
$ euroeval --model <model-id> --dataset sst5
```


## Named Entity Recognition

### CoNLL-2003-En

This dataset was published in [this paper](https://aclanthology.org/W03-0419/) and was
part of the CoNNL-2003 shared task. The data comes from the [Reuters
Corpus](http://www.reuters.com/researchandstandards) and consists of news articles
between August 1996 and August 1997, labelled with named entities.

The original full dataset consists of 14,041 / 3,250 / 3,453 samples for the training,
validation and test splits, respectively. We use 1,024 / 256 / 2,048 samples for our
training, validation and test splits, respectively. All the new splits are subsets of
the original splits.

Here are a few examples from the training split:

```json
{
  'tokens': array(['SK', 'Slavia', 'Praha', '3', '1', '2', '0', '6', '3', '5'], dtype=object),
  'labels': array(['B-ORG', 'I-ORG', 'I-ORG', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O'], dtype=object)
}
```
```json
{
  'tokens': array(['Guy', 'Whittingham', 'stole', 'three', 'points', 'for', 'the', 'Yorkshire', 'side', 'with', 'a', 'goal', '10', 'minutes', 'from', 'time', '.'], dtype=object),
  'labels': array(['B-PER', 'I-PER', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'B-ORG', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O'], dtype=object)
}
```
```json
{
  'tokens': array(['Dean', 'Palmer', 'hit', 'his', '30th', 'homer', 'for', 'the', 'Rangers', '.'], dtype=object),
  'labels': array(['B-PER', 'I-PER', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'B-ORG', 'O'], dtype=object)
}
```

When evaluating generative models, we use the following setup (see the
[methodology](/methodology) for more information on how these are used):

- Number of few-shot examples: 8
- Prefix prompt:
  ```
  Below are sentences and JSON dictionaries with the named entities that occur in the given sentence.
  ```
- Base prompt template:
  ```
  Sentence: {text}
  Named entities: {label}
  ```
- Instruction-tuned prompt template:
  ```
  Sentence: {text}

  Identify the named entities in the sentence. You should output this as a JSON dictionary with the keys being 'person', 'location', 'organization' and 'miscellaneous'. The values should be lists of the named entities of that type, exactly as they appear in the sentence.
  ```
- Label mapping:
    - `B-PER` ➡️ `person`
    - `I-PER` ➡️ `person`
    - `B-LOC` ➡️ `location`
    - `I-LOC` ➡️ `location`
    - `B-ORG` ➡️ `organization`
    - `I-ORG` ➡️ `organization`
    - `B-MISC` ➡️ `miscellaneous`
    - `I-MISC` ➡️ `miscellaneous`

You can evaluate this dataset directly as follows:

```bash
$ euroeval --model <model-id> --dataset conll-en
```


## Linguistic Acceptability

### ScaLA-En

This dataset was published in [this paper](https://aclanthology.org/2023.nodalida-1.20/)
and was automatically created from the [English Universal Dependencies
treebank](https://github.com/UniversalDependencies/UD_English-GUM/) by assuming that the
documents in the treebank are correct, and corrupting the samples to create
grammatically incorrect samples. The corruptions were done by either removing a word
from a sentence, or by swapping two neighbouring words in a sentence. To ensure that
this does indeed break the grammaticality of the sentence, a set of rules were used on
the part-of-speech tags of the words in the sentence.

The original full dataset consists of 1,024 / 256 / 2,048 samples for training,
validation and testing, respectively (so 3,328 samples used in total). These splits are
used as-is in the framework.

Here are a few examples from the training split:

```json
{
  "text": "And so we have to labour and to work, and to work hard, to give reality to our dreams.",
  "label": "correct"
}
```
```json
{
  "text": "This couch is also quite big, it fits three people quite comfortably, and if I have or friends staying over, it opens up into a full double bed.",
  "label": "incorrect"
}
```
```json
{
  "text": "While studies the psychology of art have focused on individual works and distinctions between representative / non-representative topics, no work has been completed on the aesthetic appreciation of collections or of devotional themes.",
  "label": "incorrect"
}
```

When evaluating generative models, we use the following setup (see the
[methodology](/methodology) for more information on how these are used):

- Number of few-shot examples: 12
- Prefix prompt:
  ```
  The following are sentences and whether they are grammatically correct.
  ```
- Base prompt template:
  ```
  Sentence: {text}
  Grammatically correct: {label}
  ```
- Instruction-tuned prompt template:
  ```
  Sentence: {text}

  Determine whether the sentence is grammatically correct or not. Reply with 'yes' if the sentence is correct and 'no' if it is not.
  ```
- Label mapping:
    - `correct` ➡️ `yes`
    - `incorrect` ➡️ `no`

You can evaluate this dataset directly as follows:

```bash
$ euroeval --model <model-id> --dataset scala-en
```


## Reading Comprehension

### SQuAD

This dataset was published in [this paper](https://aclanthology.org/D16-1264/), which is
based on English Wikipedia articles and the questions and answers are written by
crowdworkers.

The original full dataset consists of 130,000 / 11,900 samples for training and
validation, respectively. We use 1,024 / 256 / 2,048 samples for training, validation
and testing, respectively (so 3,328 samples used in total). The new training split is a
subset of the original training split, and the new validation and test splits are
disjoint subsets of the original validation split.

Here are a few examples from the training split:

```json
{
  'context': 'The Federation of International Gymnastics (FIG) was founded in Liege in 1881. By the end of the nineteenth century, men\'s gymnastics competition was popular enough to be included in the first "modern" Olympic Games in 1896. From then on until the early 1950s, both national and international competitions involved a changing variety of exercises gathered under the rubric, gymnastics, that would seem strange to today\'s audiences and that included for example, synchronized team floor calisthenics, rope climbing, high jumping, running, and horizontal ladder. During the 1920s, women organized and participated in gymnastics events. The first women\'s Olympic competition was primitive, only involving synchronized calisthenics and track and field. These games were held in 1928, in Amsterdam.',
  'question': 'When was gymnastics included in the Olympics?',

Many grand houses and public buildings, such as the National Gallery, are constructed from Portland stone. Some areas of the city, particularly those just west of the centre, are characterised by white stucco or whitewashed buildings. Few structures in central London pre-date the Great Fire of 1666, these being a few trace Roman remains, the Tower of London and a few scattered Tudor survivors in the City. Further out is, for example, the Tudor period Hampton Court Palace, England's oldest surviving Tudor palace, built by Cardinal Thomas Wolsey c.1515.",

  'context': 'Along with the rest of South West England, Plymouth has a temperate oceanic climate (Köppen Cfb) which is generally wetter and milder than the rest of England. This means a wide range of exotic plants can be grown. The annual mean temperature is approximately 11 °C (52 °F). Due to the modifying effect of the sea the seasonal range is less than in most other parts of the UK. As a result of this summer highs are lower than its southerly latitude should warrant, but as a contrast the coldest month of February has mean minimum temperatures as mild as between 3 and 4 °C (37 and 39 °F). Snow is rare, not usually equating to more than a few flakes, but there have been exclusions, namely the European winter storms of 2009-10 which, in early January, covered Plymouth in at least 1 inch (2.5 cm) of snow; more on higher ground. Another period of notable snow occurred from 17–19 December 2010 when up to 8 inches (20 cm) of snow fell through the period – though only 2 inches (5.1 cm) would lie at any one time due to melt. Over the 1961–1990 period, annual snowfall accumulation averaged less than 7 cm (3 in) per year. July and August are the warmest months with mean daily maxima over 19 °C (66 °F).',

## Knowledge

### MMLU

This dataset was published [in this paper](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2009.03300)
and features questions within 57 different topics, such as elementary mathematics, US
history and law.

The original full dataset consists of 269 / 1,410 / 13,200 samples for training,
validation and testing, respectively. We use a 1,024 / 256 / 2,048 split for training,
validation and testing, respectively (so 3,328 samples used in total). These splits are
new and there can thus be some overlap between the original validation and test sets and
our validation and test sets.

Here are a few examples from the training split:

```json
{
  "text": "Use the following key to translate the given formula of PL to natural, English sentences. A: Marina reads a Percy Jackson book. B: Izzy plays Minecraft. C: Emily stops working. D: Russell makes dinner. E: Ashleigh stops by. ~(A ⊃ B) • (B ⊃ ~E)\nChoices:\na. It's not the case that Marina's reading a Percy Jackson book entails that Izzy plays Minecraft, but Izzy's playing Minecraft does entail that Ashleigh doesn't stop by.\nb. If Marina doesn't read a Percy Jackson book, then Izzy plays Minecraft, which entails that Ashleigh doesn't stop by.\nc. Marina's reading a Percy Jackson book does not entail that Izzy plays Minecraft, but Izzy plays Minecraft provided that Ashleigh doesn't stop by.\nd. It's not true that Marina reads a Percy Jackson book only when Izzy plays Minecraft, but Izzy plays Minecraft only when Ashleigh stops by.",

When the buyer received the nails, it found their quality to be unsatisfactory and sued the seller for breach of warranty. The seller has asked an attorney whether the parties' contract requires arbitration of the buyer's claim. What is the best advice the attorney can provide?\nChoices:\na. A contract was formed pursuant to conduct when the buyer received the nails, and a court would exclude the arbitration provision from the contract.\nb. A contract was formed when the seller mailed its acknowledgment, and the arbitration term became part of the contract. arbitration term became part of the contract.\nc. A contract was formed when the seller mailed its acknowledgment, and the court must decide whether the arbitration term should be excluded as a material alteration of the contract.\nd. No contract exists, because the arbitration term in the seller's acknowledgment created a counteroffer that the buyer never accepted.",
  "label": "c"

### Unofficial: ARC

This dataset was published [in this paper](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.1803.05457)
and features US grade-school science questions.

The original full dataset consists of 1,110 / 297 / 1,170 samples for training,
validation and testing, respectively. We use a 1,024 / 256 / 1,024 split for training,
validation and testing, respectively (so 2,304 samples used in total). All new splits
are subsets of the original splits.

Here are a few examples from the training split:

```json
{
  "text": "Several horses grazed in a fenced area across from a home. On rainy days, soil would wash down a slope and run toward the home. After the horses were moved a few years later, the soil no longer washed down when it rained. What could account for this change?\nChoices:\na. The grass grew and kept the soil intact.\nb.

## Common-sense Reasoning

### HellaSwag

This dataset was published in [this paper](https://aclanthology.org/P19-1472/) and is
based on both video descriptions from ActivityNet as well as how-to articles from
WikiHow.

The original full dataset consists of 9,310 samples. We use a 1,024 / 256 / 2,048 split
for training, validation and testing, respectively (so 3,328 samples used in total).

Here are a few examples from the training split:

## Summarization

### CNN/DailyMail

This dataset was published in [this paper](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.1506.03340)
and is based on news articles from CNN and DailyMail, with the summaries derived from
bullet points written by the authors of the articles.

The original full dataset consists of 287,113 / 13,368 / 11,490 samples for training,
validation and testing, respectively. We use a 1,024 / 256 / 2,048 split for training,
validation and testing, respectively (so 3,328 samples used in total). All new splits
are subsets of the original splits.

Here are a few examples from the training split:

```json

  "text": "Reality TV star and conservative firebrand Sarah Palin said today she's 'interested' in running for president in 2016 but stopped short of saying she'd actually seek higher office. 'Yeah, I mean, of course, when you have a servant’s heart, when you know that there is opportunity to do all you can to put yourself forward in the name of offering service, anybody would be interested,' Palin told ABC News reporter Neal Karlinsky. Later stating, 'America has had enough of seeing that...sign on the Oval Office door saying, \"No Girls Allowed.\" ' 'It doesn't necessarily have to be me though,' she said. Scroll down for video . Conservative firebrand Sarah Palin said today she's 'interested' in running for president in 2016 but stopped short of saying she'd actually seek higher office . GIRL POWER: 'America has had enough of seeing that...sign on the Oval Office door saying, \"No Girls Allowed,\" ' Palin said . NOM NOM NOM: Palin made the comments while serving wild boar chili to the Salvation Army in Las Vegas, Nevada, on Friday. She was hosting an episode of Sportsman Channel program Hunt.Fish.Feed . ABC News caught up with Palin while she was serving wild boar chili to the homeless at a Las Vegas, Nevada, Salvation Army for an episode of Sportsman Channel program Hunt.Fish.Feed. She's also in the midst of promoting her hunting show, Amazing Alaska, about to begin its second season. Palin said the GOP needs to nominate a candidate 'who can take on Hillary' and 'show the nation what it is going to take to get the country back on the right track.' 'Because we can't afford status quo,' the former Alaska governor said in a clip of the interview released by ABC this afternoon. 'Status quo lately has been Latin for, \"We're getting screwed,' and status quo has got to go.' The Republican nominee out to be someone can 'turn things around, someone who will, in some respects, I don’t know, maybe be considered a bit avant garde, to the establishment anyway, because this next person has got to realize this is war, this is war for our hunters’ future,' she said at another point in the interview, according to ABC. Asked about former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush's candidacy and 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney, Palin snarked, 'I can’t wait for new energy.' Moments later asserting that the GOP primary 'had better be a competition and not a coronation.' Palin, the 2008 vice presidential nominee, said she doesn't 'have to be' the Republican candidate for president but she's 'happy to drive that competition, because competition will make everyone better and produce more and be more candid regarding their solutions they will offer this country. 'I am very interested in that competitive process and, again, not necessarily me.' Former Alaska Palin is pictured here on Thursday at an event to promote her television show, Amazing America with Sarah Palin, at the Shooting, Hunting and Outdoor Trade Show in Las Vegas . The hard-charging, Tea Party icon appears to have a change of heart in the last week about the Oval Office needing a female touch. 'I don't give a flying flip about what gender the person will be,' Palin told Inside Edition after host Deborah Norville asker her about the importance of electing a female president. 'I want the absolute best because America deserves the best, in terms of leadership, getting this country on the right track,' she continued. She ultimately concluded 'it would be nice' to have a woman president, though, 'and it will be nice to see women jump into the ring.' Voicing her support for female candidates in December, Palin told Extra TV, 'I would love to see a woman on both sides of the aisle shooting for that top spot.'",
  "target_text": "'When you know that there is opportunity to do all you can to put yourself forward in the name of offering service, anybody would be interested'\nPalin added: 'It doesn't necessarily have to be me though'\nThe conservative firebrand appears to have a change of heart about the Oval Office needing a female touch .\nLast week she said: 'I don't give a flying flip about what gender the person will be'"

The dictionary makers have taken to Twitter to find new words for the next edition of the lexicon - asking users to choose which words should make the final edition . The latest edition of the Collins English Dictionary could include Twitter slang words such as 'adorkable' and 'fatberg'. The dictionary makers have taken to Twitter to find new words for the next edition of the lexicon - asking users to choose which words should make the final edition. The list of suggested words includes fracktivist - someone who protests against fracking - and felfie, a term used to describe a farmer who takes a selfie, or photograph of themselves. The 12th edition of the dictionary will be the first to contain a word that has been voted for by Twitter users - who have until midnight on May 28 to vote for the new word. Once selected, it will be included in the next edition of the dictionary, which is released in October. The dictionary publisher says that the rise of social media and the hashtag has seen new words and ideas - that they scout for every year - become mainstream much quicker than in the past. Andrew Freeman, associate publisher at Collins, said: 'Twitter offers us an immediate snapshot of how much a word is used. 'The tried and tested approach to compiling dictionaries has to adapt to embrace the ways in which language is developing through use on social media, and this is a fun way to get Twitter users involved in defining the English language.' Collins has been publishing the dictionary since 1819 and is the largest single volume dictionary in print, with the words it contains sourced from the Collins Corpus, which contains more than 4.5 billion words, as well as the open source site collinsdictionary.com, where users can submit words for consideration.

Lucy Mangan, a blogger for collinsdictionary.com and a contributor to the Collins English Dictionary, said: 'Twitter is the perfect place to find out what people are really saying and how they’re saying it. 'It’s a space in which you’re freer than almost anywhere else to combine old words, resurrect others or invent totally new ones whenever the need arises.' According to language experts, the list, which also contains the word adorkable, referring to someone who is dorky in an adorable way, is a sign of the way language is changing in the 21st century. Ian Brookes, lexicographer and consultant editor to the Collins English Dictionary, said: 'Language has always had to develop in response to changes in society and technology. In the 20th century the development of the motor car, air travel, television, and the personal computer changed the things that people did and so brought many new words into the language. 'In the 21st century, the growth of social media has had a comparable effect. Twitter users can vote for their choice by visiting twictionary.collinsdictionary.com .

  "text": "There were three of them, one of them probably a child, and at least one met a gruesome end at the hands of a terrifying predator. About 67 million years later, a Wyoming rancher led scientists to their remains. Now experts are digging out one of the most complete skeletons yet of a Triceratops, the three-horned, plant-eating dinosaur that was one of the last of the giant reptiles. \"There's only three other skeletons that will match the completeness of one of the specimens we're excavating right now,\" said paleontologist Peter Larson, president of the Black Hills Institute of Geological Research. Most of the remains found before now have included fewer than half of the prehistoric creatures' bones, Larson said Monday. The most complete to date, now on display at the Houston Museum of Natural Science in Texas, has about 76% of its skeleton. \"The largest, more mature individual appears to be the most complete,\" Larson said. \"One is just a bit smaller, and there's another one that by live weight is probably only half the size.\" Will mammoths be brought back to life? Liquid blood fuels cloning hopes . The dig is going on near Newcastle, Wyoming, more than 200 miles north of Cheyenne. \"The fact that there are three of them together is really cool,\" Larson said. The trio could be male and female and their young, or they could be two females looking after a juvenile dinosaur, he said. And before now, there was no indication that the Triceratops moved in groups. The Black Hills Institute is working with the Naturalis Biodiversity Center, from the Netherlands, on the dig. Larson called the discovery of a young Triceratops a \"very significant\" find as well, since it will give scientists an insight into how the great lizards grew up. Newly discovered dinosaur fossil is a primitive bird . Triceratops lived in the twilight of the Cretaceous Period, about a half a million years before the dinosaurs' extinction. Much of what is now the Great Plains and southern Canada was once part of a vast inland sea, and the region is rich in fossils. \"Like most of the specimens that were found, it was brought to our attention by a rancher,\"  Larson said. The rancher sent photos to the Black Hills Institute, located in neighboring South Dakota, in late 2012. Excavation began in May and is expected to take about a month. So far, the bones that have turned up point to a violent end, probably at the hands of the feared Tyrannosaurus rex. On the largest of the three specimens, at least two of the major limb bones were \"bitten through,\" Larson said. \"If you can imagine, this is a bone that is nearly four feet long,\" he said. But a T.rex \"would kind of chop the carcass up with their giant, shearing jaws,\" ripping through flesh and bone alike. \"I think we also have a feeding site for Tyrannosaurus rex, which is very exciting,\" he said. \"This is potentially a site where we can learn the behavior of two different species.\" More science news on CNN's Light Years blog .",
