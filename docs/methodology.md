# Evaluation Methodology

The evaluation methodology is different depending on the architecture of the model. For
encoder models, we use a finetuning approach, where we finetune the model on the
training data of the task, and evaluate it on the test data. For decoder models, we use
either a few-shot or zero-shot approach, where we evaluate the model on the test data
without any finetuning, but where the few-shot examples come from the training data of
the task. It [has been shown](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2309.05858) that the few-shot
approach corresponds to finetuning in the sense of being equivalent to gradient updates
on the training data, making the two evaluation methodologies comparable.


## Robust Evaluation

For each model and dataset, we evaluate the model as described above 10 times, each time
on a bootstrapped (i.e., sampling with replacement) version of the training and test
set. The evaluation score is then the mean of these scores, along with a 95% confidence
interval, computed as the mean ± 1.96 x [standard
error](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_error) of the mean, where the standard
error of the mean is the [sample standard
deviation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation#Corrected_sample_standard_deviation)
divided by the square root of the number of samples.

The bootstrap theorem means that this mean and associated confidence interval will be
asymptotically correct, giving us a more reliable estimate of the true performance of
the model, rather than just the performance on a single test set, which can be noisy.


## Formulating NLU Tasks as Generative Tasks

In this section we describe how we rephrase the NLU tasks as text-to-text tasks, which
makes it possible to evaluate generative models on the tasks. We set up the prompts
differently depending on whether the model is instruction tuned or not, as the
instruction tuned models require a different prompt structure to ensure that they
generate the correct output.

For the base (i.e., non-instruction tuned) models, we use the following prompt
structure:

```
[prefix prompt]

{% for each few-shot example %}
  [document prefix]: [few-shot example document]

  [label prefix]: [few-shot example label]
{% end for %}

[document prefix]: [new document]

[label prefix]:
```

For the instruction tuned models, we use the following prompt structure:

```
{% for each few-shot example %}
  USER: [instruction with few-shot example]
  ASSISTANT: [label]
{% end for %}
USER: [instruction with new example]
ASSISTANT:
```

Here we would use the model's chat template to set up the `USER` and `ASSISTANT` parts
of the prompt. See all the specific prompts used for each dataset in the [dataset
configs module](/src/euroeval/dataset_configs/#euroeval.dataset_configs).

For the sentiment classification task, we simply have the models generate translations
of the three labels (positive, negative and neutral). For the linguistic acceptability
task, also a text classification task, we use the translations of "yes" and "no" as the
two labels, corresponding to whether the document is grammatically correct or not. For
the extractive question answering task, we have the model output the answer directly.
For this task we found that changing the label prefix from "Answer" to "Answer in max 3
words" resulted in a drastic improvement, due to many of the answers of instruction
tuned models starting with unnecessary text akin to "The answer is". Lastly, for the
named entity recognition task, we require the output to be a JSON dictionary, with keys
being the translated named entity tags, and values being lists of named entities of that
category. To ensure that we are not biasing the evaluation toward models knowing the
JSON format, we employ structured generation using the
[outlines](https://github.com/dottxt-ai/outlines) package, which modifies the logits
outputted by the model to ensure that the output is always a valid JSON dictionary in
the aforementioned format.


## Score Aggregation

From the raw scores of the 10 evaluations per dataset, we need to aggregate
the model scores into a single score. We want an aggregation method that satisfies the
following criteria:

- **Task Fairness:** Each task should be weighted equally.
- **Comparison:** If we evaluate models in multiple languages, then it should be
  possible to meaningfully compare the language scores of these models with each other.
- **Robustness:** If two models do not have a significantly different score on a
  dataset, then the aggregated score should reflect this.
- **Magnitude Preservation:** The magnitude of the difference between the dataset score
  of two models should be reflected in the aggregated score.
- **Minimal Change:** Adding a new model should minimally affect the aggregated scores
  of the other models.

Before we introduce our chosen aggregation method, we will briefly discuss some common
aggregation methods and how they do not satisfy the criteria.

The **mean score** is the most common aggregation method, which would simply be the mean
of the 10 scores for each dataset, and then the mean of the dataset scores for each
task. This method does not satisfy the Task Fairness criterion, as it does not take into
account that metrics have different ranges and variances. The Comparison criterion is
also not satisfied, as datasets vary from language to language, with some datasets being
more difficult than others. It _does_, however, satisfy the Robustness, Magnitude
Preservation and Minimal Change criteria.

The **mean rank** is another common aggregation method, where we compute the rank of
each model on each dataset, and then take the mean of the ranks. This method satisfies
the Task Fairness criterion, as it re-casts the scores into a common comparable
framework, which therefore weights each task equally. For the same reason, it also
satisfies the Comparison criterion (it is important here that we evaluate all the models
on all the languages for this to be satisfied). It does not satisfy the Robustness and
Magnitude Preservation criteria, by definition of rank. It partially satisfies the
Minimal Change criterion, since it only affects the scores of the models which are worse
than the new model.

We thus see that the mean score and mean rank methods satisfy a disjoint set of the
criteria, but that they together satisfy all the criteria. Based on this observation, we
introduce the **mean rank score** method, defined as follows. For each dataset, we start
by sorting the models by their mean score on the dataset. As with a rank, we assign the
best model with rank score 1. For the next best model, we conduct a one-tailed Welch's
t-test to see if the next best model is significantly worse than the first model (p <
0.05). If so, we compute the absolute difference between the mean score of the two
models, and divide that by the standard deviation of all the mean scores of the models
on the dataset.

We then add this to the rank score of the first model. We continue this process for all
the models to get the rank scores for the dataset, and to compute the overall score for
the model, we take the mean of the rank scores for the datasets. We note that the mean
rank score has an intuitive interpretation: it is the average number of standard
deviations from the best scoring model (+1).

This metric satisfies Task Fairness since we normalise all the scores by dividing by the
standard deviation of the dataset scores. The Robustness criterion is satisfied due to
our use of a one-tailed Welch's t-test. The Magnitude Preservation criterion is also
satisfied, as the magnitude of the difference between the dataset score of two models is
reflected in the rank score. It also satisfies Comparison, as we compare the models on a
common scale (same argument as the mean rank method). Finally, the Minimal Change
criterion is partially satisfied, as adding new models only minimally changes the score
of existing models. Concretely, adding new scores will affect the standard deviation
normalising factor (this effect tends to zero as the number of models grows, however),
and if the model beats all the other models then all the scores will be affected, due to
the relative nature of the metric.
